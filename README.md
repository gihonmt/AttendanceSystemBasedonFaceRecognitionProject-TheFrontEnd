# Instructions (You can see my portfolio on the PDF file)

1. Download and install XAMPP
2. Download all the files above and put folder "interfaceoperator" and "interfaceuser" inside .../xampp/htdocs, depending on where you installed the XAMPP.
3. Run xampp_start.exe and open localhost/phpmyadmin on internet browser.
4. Make new database and name it "facepresence". Then open the database, go to "Import" section, browse and choose facepresence.sql, finally press "Go" button below.
5. Now you can access the web-based application by typing localhost/interfaceuser on smartphone for accessing "Interface User" and localhost/interfaceoperator on PC/Laptop for accessing "Interface Operator".

P.S. For "Interface User" you can see the data for login information in the database and choose penggunapresensi2, username is the ID and password is the Nama with all characters lowercase and no spaces. For "Interface Operator" there are 2 data for login as an operator, first "11110" as username and "tasemangat" as password, second "11112" as username and "tugasakhir2" as password.
